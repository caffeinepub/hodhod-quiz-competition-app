REQ-31 (frontend audit) shows evidence of corrections to flag questions in frontend/src/data/questions.ts with corrected correctAnswerIndex values and documentation. However, the diff is truncated showing only ~14 flag questions when 50+ were expected. REQ-32 (backend update) shows only 3 flag question mappings in backend/main.mo instead of the 50+ needed to align with the corrected frontend data.",
