  "summary": "The diff implements all five requirements (REQ-14 through REQ-18). The question pool was expanded to 15-18 questions per category in Persian, visual feedback with green/red colors and 1.5-second delay was added, background music and sound effects were integrated with proper audio management, and all changes maintain the existing theme and constraints.",

      "reason": "The timer is paused during the answer feedback display (via isActive prop checking selectedAnswer === null), but this behavior was not requested in the BuildRequest. The requirement only specified visual feedback display for at least 1 second before transitioning, not timer pause.",
