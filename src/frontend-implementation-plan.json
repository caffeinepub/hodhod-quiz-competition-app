For each flag question, cross-reference the image property (e.g., 'frontend/public/assets/generated/flag-iran.dim_200x133.png') with the options array to identify which index contains the correct country name (e.g., 'ایران'). Update the correctAnswer field for any questions where the index is incorrect. Maintain all existing Persian text, options order, and image URLs without modification."
