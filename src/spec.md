# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Display the correct answer when the game ends and increase the question timer from 7 to 12 seconds.

**Planned changes:**
- Show the correct answer on the game over screen when the user loses
- Increase the countdown timer from 7 seconds to 12 seconds per question
- Update the welcome screen text to reflect the new 12-second time limit

**User-visible outcome:** Players will have 12 seconds to answer each question instead of 7, and when they lose, they'll see what the correct answer was.
